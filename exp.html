                            <li>Used LLMs to extract solvent and electrolyte data from 7500+ battery papers and constructed a database containing relevant information</li>
                            <li>Created a random forest classification model to analyze and predict correlation between factors related to issues in the battery production process</li>
                            <li>Developed tools that calculated Tanimoto similarity scores and used K-means clustering to aid scientists in finding desirable chemical compounds</li>
                            <li>Built a web app used company-wide to search a database of academic articles and retrieve data generated during the battery manufacturing process</li>
