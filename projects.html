                        <h2>Car Driving Reinforcement Learning Model</h2>
                        <p>I created an RL Model that learns to drive a car along a circular track. I created a simple game as the base environment in which the player uses the arrow keys to control the car. The objective is to complete a lap as fast as possible, and if the car goes off the track, it resets at its starting position. I utilized an Epsilon-Greedy Q-Learning algorithm to implement the RL model. After about 60,000 iterations, the car was able to drive a full lap on its own.<br><br>See more details <a href="https://github.com/adikoul04/Projects/tree/main/Car_Driving_RL_Model" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>For a while, I played a mobile game called <em>Top Drives</em> in which cars are given ratings based on a number of factors including power, weight, drivetrain, tire type, and more. I created a neural network trained on data of 435 cars in the game to predict the rating of new cars given stats entered by the user.<br><br>See more details <a href="https://github.com/adikoul04/Projects/tree/main/Top_Drives_Neural_Network" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
